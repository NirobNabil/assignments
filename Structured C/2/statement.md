xyz has n girlfriends. It has been really long since he visited them. So everyone is angry at him. Now he has to spend time with them to make everyone happy. But as always its more complicated than that.

every i-th girlfriend has an initial anger level a<sub>i</sub>. if he spends x unit of  time with i-th girlfriend, a<sub>i</sub> drops by x unit ( ai = ai-x ). But at the same time anger level of every other girlfriend increases by x, formally, for every p where p != i -> a<sub>p</sub> = a<sub>p</sub> + x )
 
now he wants to have everyone's anger level to be less than or equal to zero. Find the minimum amount of time he has to spend to make ai = 0 for every i from 1 to n.
